Forked here on github so I could implement my patches in an open forum thanks to GPLv2 (/doc/README).

Fixes/features thus far that are not upstream:

Features:
-Support for percentages when creating logical volumes (100%FREE)

Fixes:
-Builds kernel/initrd and sets up grub after all packages installed. Current upstream builds
 packages after the initrd, causing lvm2 utils to be missing/system cannot boot.
