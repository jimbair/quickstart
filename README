Quickstart - Installer for automated Gentoo deployments.

Forked here on github so I could implement my patches in an open forum thanks to GPLv2 (/doc/README).

Another fork called Kicktoo can be found here, buit as of late 2018, it was also broken: https://github.com/r1k0/kicktoo

The changes I made here were issued in a PR to Andrew, which he didn't merge nor did he fix himself, so I guess I'll work work off of my own repo to get this working!

Fixes:

Features:
-Support for percentages when creating logical volumes (100%FREE)
-Support for grub2

Fixes:
-Builds kernel/initrd and sets up grub after all packages installed. Current upstream builds
 packages after the initrd, causing lvm2 utils to be missing/system cannot boot.
